在6/23-6/26，  
跟大學同學去**宜花畢業旅行**。  
真的是累死了，  
一直唱歌喉嚨好痛。  
然後又每天聊天聊到一兩點。  
  
因為疫情的關係大家好久沒有聚在一塊，  
現在好不容易聚在一起，  
反而已經是最後一次了。  
畢業之際，雖然有許多不錯的回憶，  
但心中真的還有許多滿滿的不捨。  
  
`之後照片整理整理後再寫一篇文章吧！`  
  
現在真的沒辦法。  
一回來就好多東西要忙==  
例如實習前要研讀的許多教程資料；  
7/3要準備考的日檢N1；  
或是日本交換線上課程準備要考期末；  
更甚至最近家裡裝潢完成需要開始搬東西。  
~~或是要再去新竹領畢業證書之類的==~~  
  
`總之就是很多東西。`
  
--  
  
然後最近水電工、第四台、裝冰箱等等工人，  
一直來，  
我最近的下午完全沒辦法念書。  
  
雖然覺得他們真的很累很辛苦，  
可是......  
我真的要開天窗啦！  
啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！  
  
然後還要碩士註冊前體檢，  
插座還因為水電師傅接錯，  
印表機不小心燒掉？  
  
太多事了吧！  
我真的要崩潰了喔？

#### 稍微的筆記
##### Deep Learning with Python - Chollet
* **Optimization:** the process of adjusting a model to get the best performance possible on the training data.
* **Generalization:** how well the trained model performs on data it has never seen before.
* **Regulization:** the process of fighting overfitting.
##### Preventing overfitting:
* Get more training data.
* Reduce the capacity of the network.
* Add weight regularization.
* Add **dropout**. (**introducing noice**)

#### Finding Alphas: A Quantitative Approach to Building Trading Strategies - Tulchinsky et al.
##### Introduction to Alpha Design
* **Alpha design**: A forecast of the return on each of the financial securities, to make predictions about future movements.
* **Data \\(\rightarrow\\) (e.g. historical proces, volume, shares traded, etc.)  \\(\rightarrow\\) Alpha  \\(\rightarrow\\) Price Prediction**
* The existence of alphas is a result of the **imperfect flow of information** among market participants with competing objectives.
* Rules in trading are called alphas.
* **Cutting losses**: Letting go of rules that no longer work.
* **Applying all rules simultaneously is the key to success.** No single rule can ever be relied upon completely, so it's necessary to come up with a **strategy for using rules simultaneously.** (Some rule should be cut immediately when emergency happens)
##### Design and Evaluation
##### Alpha design
* Typically, an alpha is utilized as a component of a trading strategy, which converts the alpha's predictions into actual trading decisions. The strategy also considers practical issues such as **transaction costs** and **portfolio risk.**
##### Alpha Types  
* 1. **Intraday alphas**: rebalanced during trading hours of the day.  
(1) Rebalance at each interval. e.g. 1 min/5 min.  
(2) Rebalance triggered by some events such as ticks/orders/fills or predefined events.
* 2. **Daily alphas**: rebalance every day.  
(1) Delay N: use data of N days ago.  
(2) Delay 0 snapshot: use data before a certain time snapshot.  
(3) MOO/MOC: alphas trade at market open/close auction session.
* 3. **Weekly/Monthly alphas**: rebalanced every week/month.
##### Development of an alpha:
* Using **public information** by searching signals/patterns:  
(1) Price/Volume.  
(2) Fundamentals.  
(3) Macro data.  
(4) Text.  
(5) Multimedia. (Extract text information from the video/audio).
* Other information from which alphas are not derived directly but may be used to improve the performance of alphas:  
(1) **Risk factor models**. (risk mitigation.)  
(2) **Relationship models**. (lead or lag due to correlation.)  
(3) **Microstructure models**. (real trading.)
***
##### Practical alpha evaluaion
* Run a simulation (backtest) to measure **characteristics**:  
(1) **Information ratio:** The mean of the alpha's returns divided by the standard deviation of the returns.  
-> Measure **Consistency.**  
-> which combined with the **length of the observation peroid** can be used to determine how confident we are to determine that the alpha is **not some random noise.**  
(2) **Margin**: The amount of profit made by the alpha in the simulation divided by the amount of trading that was done.  
-> Measure **Sensitivity to transaction costs.**  
(3) **Uniqueness:** The maximum correlation of the alpha to others in the pool of alphas.  
-> Lower correlation means **more valuable alpha.**
##### Develop an alpha:
* 1. Collect information.
* 2. Come up with an idea.
* 3. Translate into a mathematical expression. (Positive alpha \\(\rightarrow\\) long position, vice versa.)
* 4. Transform the raw expression by applying operations.
* 5. Final robust alpha.
* 6. Translate into positions in a financial instrument.
* 7. Check for robustness, such as **High In-sample / Good Out-of-sample Information Ratio, less fitting, small drawdown, etc.**
##### Improving alpha:
* **Risk mitigation**: requiring our portfolios to be always long/short balanced within each industry.
* **Relative size** is more accurate as a predictor: **Concept of rank.**
* **Using Decay**: averaging alpha signal within a time window. (To reduce turnover.)
#### 今日其他進度：  
* 日文N1文法、N1題目  
* 一堆的動畫

我會繼續努力的。
