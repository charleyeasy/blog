PSG報輸啊。  
13-0。  
有點慘。  
  
之前充電器忘在家裡沒帶回來新竹。  
所以買了個新的充電器。  
之前用舊的充電器，邊衝邊用ipad時  
都不會有筆跳來跳去的問題。  
而現在用新的就有。  
  
然後這陣子我又把舊的充電器帶回來了。  
但現在ipad不管有沒有充電  
我寫的時候都不定時的亂跳。  
超煩。  
  
2ㄏ，尤其是今天上隨機過程。  
聽不懂就算了。  
抄筆記的時候還一直跳來跳去！  
我真的快崩潰了喔！

#### 稍微的筆記  
##### ch29 Exchange and OTC markets
##### exchange
* consolidate ─ 鞏固、合併、統一
* Exchange use **central counterparties** (CCPs) to clear trades btw two members.
* bilateral / multilateral netting ─ 雙邊 / 多邊結算
* **Variation margin** and **daily settlement** are interrelated.
* **default fund contributions**: if the **initial margin** is insufficient. (recall: defined **contribution** plan 確定**提撥**制)
* CCPs pay interest on **initial margin only**, which is calculated as a function of futures price volatility and is determined by the **exchange**.
* When providing noncash margin (securities e.g., T-bills), the equivalent cash would be a discounted amount of the securities' value, with the discount known as a **haircut**, which is **positively correlated with the price volatility** of the underlying asset.  

##### OTC
* **OTC derivatives** are privately negotiated bilateral contracts transacted in a market with little or no regulation, which allows for contracts to be **tailored** (量身訂製).
* For OTC derivatives, clearing and settlement are bilaterally negotitaed too, which did not generally mitigate risk.
* OTC derivatives comprise of five broad classes:  
  
* 1. interest rate (dominating)
* 2. foreign exchange
* 3. equity
* 4. commodity (smallest portion)
* 5. credit default swaps  
* margin requirement: initial requirement.
* **maintenance margin**: minimum margin account balance required to **retain the position**.
* **margin call**: if margin account balance falls velow the maintenance margin, the investor gets a **margin call**, and he must bring the margin account back to the initial margin amount. (The amount necessary to do this is called the **variation margin**)
##### ch30 Central Clearing
* When a member defaults, rather than closing out the trades at market value, CCP typivally **auctions off** the trades to the surviving members througn an auctioning process.
* Also, **Loss mutualization** refers to members' contributions to a **default fund** to cover future losses from member defaults and failed auction.
* The initial margin set by a CCP is dependent on the risk of the **transactions**, not the **members**.
* Clearing members typically include **large players only**, including large banks and global financial institutions.
##### Regulatory Initiatives for OTC Markets:
* 1. standardized OTC derivatives must be cleared through CCPs. → fewer interconnections btw dealers, thereby **reducing systemic risk**.
* 2. standardized OTC derivatives must be traded on electronic platforms. → increasing **price transparency**.
* 3. all OTC trades must be reported to a central trade repository. → regulators are given **key inputs in determining the risks** involved with OTC derivatives.
##### Advantanges and disadvantages of Central Clearing: 
###### Advantanges
* 1. Default management. (Counterparty risk)
* 2. Loss mutualization.
* 3. Legal and operational efficiency.
* 4. Liquidity.
* 5. Standardized documention.
* 6. Increased transparency.
###### Disadvantanges
* 1. Moral hazard.
* 2. Adverse selection.
* 3. **Procyclicality** (順週期性): reflects a scenario where a CCP increases margin requirements in volatile markets or during a crisis, which may **aggravate** (加劇) systemic risk.
##### Novation and Netting: 
* **Novation**: the legal process of interposing the CCP btw the seller and the buyer. (e.g., Through novation, one contract (the bilateral contract **btw OTC participants**) is replaced with another contract **with the CCP**.)
***
##### Risks faced by CCPs:
* 1. Default risk.
* 2. Model risk. (Because OTC deratives are priced using valuation models rather than by the market.) Model risk could arise due to errors **pertaining** (關於)  to volatility and in that regard, initial margins should be **amended** (修正) frequently to **correspond with** (對應) changes in volatility.
* 3. Liquidity risk.
* 4. Operational risk.
* 5. Legal risk: **Litigation** (訴訟) or **claims** (索賠) may arise due to differing laws in different jurisdictions or laws that are inconsistent with CCP's regulations. (e.g., the **segregation** (隔離) and movement of margin and positions througn a CCP.)
* 6. Investment risk.
* turbulent ─ 亂流 
##### ch31 Futures Markets
* **Open interest**: 未平倉量
* stipulate ─ 規定
* **tick size**: the minimum price fluctuation for the contract.
* **basis** \\( = {spot  \space price} - futures \space price\\). That is, the basis converges toward zero as the maturity date nears.
* All asset quality, asset quantity, delivery arrangements, and delivery time are characteristics specified by a futures contract.
##### Types of Trading Orders: 
* Market orders: buy or sell at the best price available.
* **Discretionary** (斟酌) **order**: is a market order where the broker has the option to delay transaction in search of a better price.
* Limit orders: buy or sell away from the current market price.
* **Stop-loss orders**: can make broker to sell the stock in order to prevent losses.
* **Stop-limit orders**: a combination of a stop and limit order.
* **Market-if-touched orders** (MIT orders) : would become market orders once a specified price is reached in the marketplace.
* **Good-till-canceled (GTC) orders** (also called **open orders**): remain open until they either transact or are canceled.
* **Fill-or-kill orders**: must be executed immediately or the trade will not take place.
##### Marking to market
* Futures contracts are settled daily, therefore, all gains and losses for a given year would be considered realized and, therefore, must recorded each year. (e.g., **marked to market**)
* Forwards settle at expiration; futures are marked to market and settle daily.
##### Functions of the exchange: 
* Determine which contracts trade.
* Receive margin deposits from **brokers** (so-called **clearing members**).
