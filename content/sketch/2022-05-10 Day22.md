#### 稍微的筆記  
##### ch27
* commingled ─ 混和的
* sovereign debt ─ 公債 (主權的債)
* fund's Net  Asset Value  (NAV)\\(=\dfrac{\sum {(Asset-Liability)}}{{shares}\quad {outstanding}}\\)
* front-end load: upon initial investment.
* back-end load: when investor sells an investment in the fund.
##### open-end mutual funds vs. close-end mutual funds
* 1. close-end mutual fund's # shares remains static.
* 2. open-end fund share can only be bought or sold **at specific times** (and can only be bought or sold using a **market order**), while close-end can be bought or sold at **any time**.
* 3. open-end fund always transact at the **next available NAV**, while close-end can transact at a price other than NAV.  
  
* Exchange-traded funds (ETFs): enable instant diversification **like an open-end fund**, but they are exchanged-traded **as a closed-end fund** (typically trade at their NAV).
##### undesirable trading behaviors:
* Late trading
* Market timing
* Front running
* **Directed brokerage** (經濟): involves a **quid pro quo** (交換條件) whereby a mutual fund will direct trades to a broker in exchange for the broker investing its clients in the mutual fund. (**not illegal**)
##### hedge funds
* Since hedge funds are not required to redeem shares any time an investor requests, they have **lockup periods**.
* **Lockup period** is a certain amount of time in which the investor is not able to withdraw his funds.
* fee structure: **2 plus 20%**, which means flat 2% of all assets + additional 20% of all profits above a specified benchmark. (the additional is so-called **incentive fee**.)
* **incentive fee** = \\( 0.2\times \max{(R\times A-0.02\times A,0)}\\)
* Safeguards (for investors) :
* 1. **hurdle** (柵欄) **rate**. (like a benchmark)
* 2. **high-water mark clause**(條款): previous losses must be recouped (補償) and hurdle rate surpassed.
* 3. **clawback** (奪回) **clause**: enables investors to retain a portion of previously paid incentive fees in an escrow (第三方託管) account. (to offset subsequent losses)
##### hedge fund strategies
* Long/Short Equity: find mispriced securities.
* Dedicated short: find a company is overvalued and then short sell.
* Distressed Debt: search for those **junk bonds**.
* Merger Arbitrage: find arbitrage opportunities after mergers are announced.
* Convertible Arbitrage: develop model to estimate **convertible bonds**.
* Fixed-Income Arbitrage: exploit perceived mispricing long positions in underpriced bonds, vice versa.
* Emerging Market: investments in developing countries.
* Global Macro: profit from a macroeconomic trend that they feel is in disequilibrium.
* Managed Futures: try to predict future movements in commodity prices and invest according to those predictions.  
##### ch28
* There's no standardization for **forward contracts**, which are traded in the OTC.
* **Futures contracts** are more formalized, which are traded on an exchange.
***
#### 今日其他進度：  
* 日文N1文法、N1題目  
* FRM ebook ch27 28
* 一堆的動畫
