#### 稍微的筆記  
##### ch34 Pricing Financial Forwards and Futures:
##### Value of a Forward Contract:
* The **forward price** at every moment in time is computed to prevent arbitrage, the value at inception of the contract must be zero.
* If we denote the obligated delivery price after inception as K, then the **value of long contract** on an asset **with an annual dividend yield of q** is computed as: \\(\dfrac{S}{(1+q)^T}-\dfrac{K}{(1+r)^T}\\)
* If interest rates rise, then the **underlying assets** will fall in value. That is, there's a loss on both futures and forwards contracts. However, with **futures**, a loss from an asset price decrease will be **recognized immediately** (due to **daily settlement**). In that regard, a **forward contract is more desirable** and would be price higher.
##### ch35 Commodity Forwards and Futures:
* Commodities prices tend to be **mean-reverting**.
##### Energy:
* 1. Crude oil: easy to transport.
* 2. Natural gas: is **expensive to store**.
* 3. **Electricity: is not generally a storable commodity.** Due to that, **arbitrage opportunities do not exist with electricity.** In other words, **futures prices on electricity can be much more volatile than financial futures**. 
##### Commodity Arbitrage:
* The makets for those commodities that are **storable** are called as **carry markets**.
* **cash-and-carry arbitrage:** 
* 1. \\(F_{0,T}=(S_0+U)\times(1+r)^T\\), where U implys storage costs.
* 2. \\(F_{0,T}=(S_0-I)\times(1+r)^T\\), where I implys income(or we can say the storage costs are negative.)
* 3. The commodity forward price **with an active lease market** is expressed as: $$F_{0,T}=S_0\times[\dfrac{(1+r)}{(1+\delta)}]^T$$, where \\(\delta \\) implys lease rate.
* 4. The forward price including a **convenience yield** is calculated as: $$F_{0,T}\geq (S_0+U)\times[\dfrac{(1+r)}{(1+Y)}]^T$$, where Y implys annualized convenience yield.
* **Convenience Yield** (便利孳息) : The nonmonetary benefit of holding excess inventory. (which is only **relevant** (有效) when **a commodity is stored**. e.g., in a carry market.)
* **Lease rate** is similar to the **dividend payment** in a financial forward, which can be **negative.**
##### Futures Prices and Expected Spot Prices:
* \\(E(S_T)=F\dfrac{(1+X)^T}{(1+r)^T}\\), where X implys expected return on futures position.
* Recall that **Systematic risk** is a function of the **correlation btw the return on the market versus the underlying asset.** If the correlation is positive, then **X should exceed r.**
* **Normal backwardation** (正常倒退):  If the correlation is positive, X > r, thus **\\(E(S_T)>F\\)**.
* **Contango** (期貨升水): If the correlation is negative, \\(E(S_T)<F\\).
