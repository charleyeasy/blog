#### 稍微的筆記  
##### ch42 Mortgages and Mortgage-Backed Securities
* **Government Loans**: backed by federal government agencies.
* **Conventional loans**: securitized by **government-sponsored enterprises**(GSEs) ─ FHLMC or FNMA.
* **Agency (Conforming) MBSs**: guaranteed by GSEs.
* **Nonagency (nonconforming) MBSs**: issued privately with no guarantee from GSEs.
##### Pass-Through Securities
* A mortgage pass-through security represents a claim against a pool of mortgages.
* The most important characteristic of pass-through securities is their **prepayment risk.**
* **Conditional prepayment rate** (CPR): a benchmark for **prepayment rate**.
* **Single monthly mortality rate** (SMM): mothly prepayment rate converted from CPR.
* SMM is also called **constant maturity mortality**.
* \\(SMM=1-(1-CPR)^\dfrac{1}{12}\\)
* \\(CPR=1-(1-SMM)^{12}\\)
* **PSA standard benchmark**: \\(CPR=max(0.2\% \times month,6\%) \\)
##### Trading Pass-Through Agency MBS
* **Specified pools market**.
* **To Be Announced (TBA) Market**: more liquid than specified pools.
##### Dollar Roll Transaction
* Same securities to be priced for **different settlement dates**.
* **Value of a dollar roll** \\(=A-B+C-D\\), where:  
A = Proce at which pool is sold in month 1, with accrued interest.  
B = Proce at which pool is bought in month 2, with accrued interest.  
C = Interest earned on funds from the sale for one month.  
D = Coupon and principal payment that was foregone on the pool sold in month 1.  
##### Collateralized Mortgage Obligations
* **Collateralized Mortgage Obligations**(CMOs): are issued **against pass-through securities** for which the cash flows have been reallocated to different bond classes called *tranches*.
##### CMOs Types:
* 1. **Planned Amortization Class** (PAC):  
<1> A tranche that is amortizd based on a sinking fund schedule that is established within a range of prepayment speeds called the *initial PAC collar* or *initial PAC bond*.  
<2> Packaged with a **support tranche** created from the original mortgage pool, which provides **prepayment risk protection**.  
<3> Support tranche may **absorbs the excess** if prepayment rates are faster than upper prepayment rate. However, if prepayment speeds are below the lower prepayment rate, the funds needed to **keep the PAC on schedule** come from *the cash flows scheduled for the support tranche*.  
<4> **Inverse relationship** between the prepayment risk of PAC traches and the prepayment risk associated with the *support tranches*. In other words, **the certainty of PAC bond cash flow comes at the expence of increased risk to the support tranches.**  
<5> To sum up, PAC have **priorty claim against cash flows, payments to the support tranches must be deffered until PAC repayment schedule is satisfied.**
* 2. **Principal-only securities** (PO):  
<1> Sensitive to prepayment rate.  
<2> Cash flow stream **starts small** and increases with the passage of time.  
<3> Higher prepayment rates result in *faster-than-expected return* of principal and, thus, **a higher yield for PO.**
* 3. **Interest-only securities** (IO):  
<1> Major risk is the value of the cash flow investors receive.  
<2> Cash flow **starts big** and gets smaller over time.  
<3> Only IO are at risk of **incurring losses.**
