#### 稍微的筆記  
##### CFA ch32 Capital budgeting
##### Categories of Capital budgeting Projects:
* 1. Replacement projects to maintain the business: whether the existing operations should continue. (*not detailed*)
* 2. Replacement projects for cost reduction. (detailed)
* 3. Expansion projects. (detailed)
* 4. New product or market development. (detailed)
* 5. Mandatory projects: involve safety-related or environmental concerns, and generating little revenue.
* 6. Other projects: not easily analyzed or high-risk. (e.g. R&D)
##### Capital budgeting Principles:
* 1. *Decisions are based on cash flow, not accounting income*.  
<1> **Sunk costs**: costs cannot be avoided even if the project isn't undertaken.  
<2> **Externalities**: effects after the acceptance of a project.  
<3> **Cannibalization**: negative externality.  
<4> **Conventional cash flow pattern**: sign on the cash flows change **only once**.  
-> **Unconventional cash flow pattern** may cause **multiple IRR** or **no IRR** problems because the project has cash outflows during its life.
* 2. *Cash flows are based on opportunity costs.*
* 3. *The timing of cash flows is important.*
* 4. *Cash flows are analyzed on an after-tax basis*: The impact of taxes must be considered.
* 5. *Financing costs are reflected in the project's required rate of return.*
##### Affect
* **Mutually exclusive**: can accept either A or B, **but not both.**
* **Project Sequencing**: projects must be undertaken in **certain order.**
* **Unlimited funds**: can undertake all projects with expected return \\(\geq\\) cost of capital.
* **Capital rationing**: have constraints on the amount of capital.
##### NPV
* NPV: sum of PV of all the expected incremental cash flows.
* IRR: the discount rate that makes \\(NPV=0\\).
* *IRR decision rule*:  
If \\(IRR>\\) The **required rate of return** (or we can say firm's **cost of capital**.)  
-> Accept the project.
* **hurdle rate**: The **minimum IRR** that a firm requires for a project to be accepted.
* The **NPV method** assumes that a project's cash flows will be reinvested at the *cost of capital*, while **IRR method** assumes they will be reinvested at the *IRR*.
* If NPV and IRR methods give *conflicting decisions* for **mutually exclusive projects**, the **NPV decision** should be used to select the project.
##### Payback Period
* **Payback period** (PBP): number of years it takes to recover the initial cost of an investment.
* **Discounted payback period**: number of years it takes to recover the initial cost of an investment in PV terms.
* **Profitability Index** (PI): \\(PI=\dfrac{PV\space of\space future\space cash\space flows}{CF_0}=1+\dfrac{NPV}{CF_0}\\)

#### 今日其他進度：  
* 日文N1文法、N1題目  
* CFA ch32

我會繼續努力的。
